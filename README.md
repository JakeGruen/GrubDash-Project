GrubDash
This project was designed to showcase what we have learned so far in the backend portion of Thinkful's Software Engineering program. The goal of the project is to build out a RESTful API that can function independently, or in conjunction with a provided web application, that will allow a user to create, update, and view food orders for a fictional business, 'GrubDash'.

Concepts Implemented and Explored
Creating single responsibility middleware
Allowing for CRUDL operations
Following RESTful API practices
Passing error objects with a status and message to the error handler
